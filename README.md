# Linkgroups
> A Chrome extension helping you manage your tabs.

There's quiet a few extensions that helps you manage your session like
[Save my Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-my-tabs/djadfifncobffjpicnkiegahdiobpaap),
[Session Buddy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko) or
[Please, Save My Tabs!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/please-save-my-tabs/lifcohecdiblhheidnilbjkkjgjdbgjh).
However they're either needlessly complex or they lack customizability.
That's why I created this extension as I can easily add new features myself whenever I need.
